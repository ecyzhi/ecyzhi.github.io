      <h1>Spreading Card Animation in Flutter</h1>
      <p>
        Recently I have come across a youtube video
        <a href="https://youtu.be/6TYkDy54q4E">
          ImNotGoodEnough.js by Hyperplexed
        </a>
        explaining on how to overcome imposter syndrome. I am amazed by the
        example he showed in the video and his way of breaking down complex
        problems has really opened my eyes. Most of the time, I have been relied
        on various package to finish the tasks assigned with tight deadline. So
        what if I actually have time to invest into it, can I make something
        that will actually impress the others just like how I am impressed by
        the spreading card animation shown in the video? With that thought in
        mind, I decided to put my previous experience in Flutter to use. I tried
        to replicate the animation by using Flutter instead of HTML, CSS and
        Javascript . It may not be as impressive as the video, but I consider
        this as a baby step for me on the way of improvement.
      </p>

      <p>First of all, create a simple card by styling a Container widget.</p>
      <img

        alt=""
        class="img-100"
      />
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/card_1.png"
        alt=""
        class="img-50"
      />

      <p>
        To make use of animation, the HomeState need to use
        TickerProviderStateMixin. Then declare all the necessary variables for
        animation, i.e. Duration for animation, AnimationController,
        Animation&lt;double&gt; for rotation and Animation&lt;Offset&gt; for
        translation. Rotation is performed radian value. We can import
        'dart:math' library and try to convert from degree into radian.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/code_2.png"
        alt=""
        class="img-50"
      />
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/code_3.png"
        alt=""
        class="img-100"
      />

      <p>
        Next, wrap the Container widget with AnimatedBuilder,
        Transform.translate and Transform.rotate widgets to apply the animation.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/code_5.png"
        alt=""
        class="img-80"
      />

      <p>
        In case we need to see the final position after animation, we can add
        controller.forward() in the initState. This was useful when we want to
        check on the final design when adjusting multiple cards later.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/code_4.png"
        alt=""
        class="img-50"
      />
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/card_2.png"
        alt=""
        class="img-50"
      />

      <p>
        Wrap the Container widget with InkWell and pass in onHover. When the
        mouse enter the InkWell region, onHover value will be true. Call
        controller.forward() to spread the card outwards and
        controller.reverse() to move the card back to the original position.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          Note: If you have the initState in previous steps, you can comment or
          remove that out so that the card is at the center of the screen when
          you run the app.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>
          Note 2: If you cannot see the changes, try to restart the app instead
          of hot reload.
        </em>
      </p>
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/code_6.png"
        alt=""
        class="img-80"
      />
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/card_3.gif"
        alt=""
        class="img-50"
      />

      <p>
        Now a single card animation has been completed. What's next? We need to
        create a stack of cards. Those cards need to have spread into different
        position and rotate differently in an arc. To make our life easier, we
        will create a model called CardAnimation that stores the variables that
        needed for animation. Named constructor is used so that we can just pass
        in the controller, position and degree when creating the model.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/code_7.png"
        alt=""
        class="img-100"
      />

      <p>
        Now that we have the model ready. We can extract the widgets in Stack
        into a separated widget. A isBig parameter is used to determine the size
        of the card.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/code_8.png"
        alt=""
        class="img-100"
      />

      <p>
        The Home widget has been simplified and everything should still works.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/code_9.png"
        alt=""
        class="img-100"
      />

      <p>
        Next, declare all the rotation and translation in the state object. Then
        map from the model list to AnimatedCard widgets in build method.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/code_10.png"
        alt=""
        class="img-100"
      />

      <p>
        However, it is not working as expected. The cards are not spreading out
        at the same time. Because we are calling individual AnimationController
        when calling the .forward() method. So only the hovered card triggers
        the animation.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/card_4.gif"
        alt=""
        class="img-50"
      />

      <p>
        To solve that, we pass the cardList into the AnimatedCard widget and
        update the InkWell onHover. Whenever a card is hovered, loop through the
        card list and call the .forward() methods. The method is passed to
        forEach as a tear off.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/code_11.png"
        alt=""
        class="img-80"
      />
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/code_12.png"
        alt=""
        class="img-80"
      />

      <p>
        Update the build method in Home widget as well. Then the cards should
        all be spreading when we hover over the cards.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/code_13.png"
        alt=""
        class="img-50"
      />
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/card_5.gif"
        alt=""
        class="img-50"
      />

      <p>
        The rest is pretty simple as the small card is the same logic. Create
        another list with different value in arguments then just pass in isBig:
        false for small cards and updated the cardList to combine both list.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/code_14.png"
        alt=""
        class="img-80"
      />
      <img
        src="../assets/blogs/spreading_card_animation/card_6.gif"
        alt=""
        class="img-50"
      />

      <p>
        Hooray, we have made the card spreading animation. I am sure there is
        another way or even better way. Do not hesitate to leave me a message if
        so. I'm more than willing to learn. Have fun creating together!
